# Plutz

``` NOTES FOR WHEN OPEN SOURCED
  Instead of an executable for each
  script I am going to just write them in main.
  To add an executable, edit Plutz.cabal and add in the
  proper module wanted. 
  
  Using an executable for each was my original intention yet I find
  this to be the better proc for right now. 
  Adding a module as an executable takes 
  only a few seconds inside Plutz.cabal.
